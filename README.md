# JavaMasterClass 🧑‍💻

This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and projects from the [Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/) by Tim Buchalka on Udemy. It serves as both a study log and a resource for reinforcing core Java concepts through hands-on code.
